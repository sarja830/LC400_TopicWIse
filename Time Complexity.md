## Time complexity

## Heap
insertion: O(logn)
Delete peak or Min/Delete Max: O(log n)
Extract Min/Extract Max: O(log n)
Deletion other than peek : O(n) [search and find]
Find min/max : O(1)
Heap creation: O(n)

## Binary Search Tree:
Insert, delete and search: Average case: O(log n), Worst Case: O(n)
