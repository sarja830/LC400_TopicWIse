SQL is a very powerful and widely-used language for managing and manipulating databases. Here are some tips to learn SQL effectively:

   1.  Understand the Basics: Before diving into complex queries, it's important to understand the basics of SQL. Start with the foundational elements like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, etc. This will help you understand how SQL commands interact with data.

   2.  Hands-On Practice: SQL is a practical language, and the best way to learn it is by doing. Try to practice with real data sets. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codecademy provide a good platform for this.

   3.  Work on Real Projects: Try to apply your SQL knowledge in real-life projects. It can be as simple as creating a database for your movie collection or something complex like a database system for a small business.

   4.  Understand Database Design: Understanding the basics of database design such as normalization, keys (primary, foreign), and relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) can help you write more efficient SQL queries.

   5.  Learn About Joins: Joins are crucial in SQL as they allow you to combine data from two or more tables. Start with basic joins like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and then proceed to more complex ones like FULL OUTER JOIN and SELF JOIN.

   6.  Master SQL Functions: SQL functions (like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN etc.) are quite useful in dealing with data. Understanding these functions will help you extract required information from databases effectively.

   7.  Error Handling: Don't be scared of errors. They are a part of the learning process. Try to understand what the error message says and use it to correct your SQL statements.

   8.  Understand Subqueries: Subqueries can help you make your queries more dynamic. They can be a bit tricky to understand, but are very powerful once you get the hang of them.

   9.  Use Online Resources: There are many online resources that provide SQL tutorials and exercises. Make use of them. Some of the popular ones include W3Schools, Khan Academy, and Coursera.

   10. SQL Performance: As you become more familiar with SQL, learn about query performance and optimization techniques. Understanding how indexes work can also be very beneficial in this regard.

   11. Be Consistent: Practice SQL regularly. Consistency is the key in learning any new skill.

Join a Community: Joining SQL related forums and communities can also be very beneficial. It will help you solve your doubts and keep you updated with the latest trends and best practices.

Remember, learning SQL is not just about memorizing commands and syntax, it's about understanding how to manipulate and retrieve data effectively. Keep practicing and you'll get better over time. Good luck!
