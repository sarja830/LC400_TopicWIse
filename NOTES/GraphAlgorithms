Four Main Algorithms:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm      |   shortest path from one node to other node    |   Elog(V)
2. Bellman Ford algorithm    |   shortest path from one node to other node    |   EV
3. Prims algorithm           |   minimum spanning tree                        |
4. Kruskal's algorithm       |   minimum spanning tree                        |
